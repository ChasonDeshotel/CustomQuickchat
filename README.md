# Custom Quickchat (BakkesMod plugin)

Enables custom quickchats in Rocket League using BakkesMod console commands

Chats are sent using the native Rocket League chat system ✔️
  - Cleaner/better than using a script + macros to simulate keypresses, which is error prone and hacky (temporarily blocks gameplay inputs while chats are being typed)

## Installation

Find the latest version in [Releases](https://github.com/smallest-cock/CustomQuickchat/releases)

## Usage

1. Bind `customQuickchat "your chat here"` however you want.
   - Can be done in the BakkesMod bindings tab, or with the [Custom Bindings Plugin](https://bakkesplugins.com/plugins/view/228) (which allows controller bindings like **circle + up** 🎮)
     
2. When you press the button, your chat will be sent 😃

### To specify chat mode:

You can add another argument at the end of the command to specify the chat mode. 

For example:

`customQuickchat "my cool chat" team` to send "my cool chat" in team chat

or `customQuickchat "my awesome chat" party` to send "my awesome chat" in party chat (if you're in a party)

### To turn chats on/off:

Run (or bind) `customQuickchat_toggle` 

..... or check/uncheck the box in plugin settings
