# Custom Quickchat (BakkesMod plugin)

Enables custom quickchats in Rocket League

Chats are sent through the native Rocket League chat system ✔️
  - Better than using a script + macros to simulate keypresses, which is error prone and hacky (temporarily blocks gameplay inputs while chats are typed out)

## Installation

Find the latest version in [Releases](https://github.com/smallest-cock/CustomQuickchat/releases)

## Usage

1. In plugin settings, click `Open Bindings Menu` to edit chat bindings and word variations
    - use `[[variation list name]]` syntax in your chats to include word variations

2. Click `Save` when you're finished
     
3. Flex your sick ass chats 😎

### To toggle chats on/off:

Run/bind `customQuickchat_toggle` 

..... or just toggle the checkbox in plugin settings
