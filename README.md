# Custom Quickchat (BakkesMod plugin)

Enables custom quickchats in Rocket League

<img src='./docs/images/cover_pic.png' alt="overview" width="600"/>


<br>

Chats are sent through the native Rocket League chat system ‚úîÔ∏è
  - Better than using a script + macros to simulate keypresses, which is error prone and hacky (temporarily blocks gameplay inputs while chats are typed out)

>[!WARNING]
>This plugin seems to be incompatible with the latest version of [BetterChat](https://bakkesplugins.com/plugins/view/416). If you have both installed your game may crash!

## üõ†Ô∏è Building
To build the project you'll need to do the following:
- install the project's dependencies with vcpkg
- have an SDK for Rocket League (RLSDK)
- compile `speech-to-text-server.pyw` into an executable named `SpeechToText.exe`

Contributions are welcome ü§ó

### vcpkg
You'll need to install the libraries found in `vcpkg.json`

Brief steps:
1. Install vcpkg ([follow step 1 here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/get-started-vs?pivots=shell-powershell#1---set-up-vcpkg))
2. `cd` to the project folder (where `vcpkg.json` is) and install the project's dependencies with
   ```vcpkg integrate install```
   - [more info here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/consume/manifest-mode?tabs=msbuild%2Cbuild-MSBuild#2---integrate-vcpkg-with-your-build-system)

### SDK
You can generate one quickly using this config from matix2: https://github.com/matix2/RLSDK-Generator

Brief steps:
1. Add the folder `Engine/RocketLeague` to the VS project (for some reason it's missing)
2. Update the offsets for `GNames`/`GObjects` and the output folder path (in `Engine/RocketLeague/Configuration.cpp`)
    - You can get the offsets for `GNames` and `GObjects` using [RocketDumper](https://github.com/lchmagKekse/RocketDumper)
3. Build
4. Inject the .dll into Rocket League, and your SDK should begin generating

>[!NOTE]
>The resulting SDK wont be perfect but it should work for the purposes of this plugin


### python script
To compile `speech-to-text-server.pyw` into an executable, I use [auto-py-to-exe](https://github.com/brentvollebregt/auto-py-to-exe) (which uses [pyinstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller) internally) with the "One Directory" option (`--onedir` in pyinstaller)

For the plugin to recognize the python program, the executable needs to be named `SpeechToText.exe` and should be located in the `bakkesmod\CustomQuickchat\SpeechToText` folder. (You can create the folder if it doesn't already exist)
