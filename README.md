# Custom Quickchat (BakkesMod plugin)

Enables custom quickchats in Rocket League

Chats are sent using the native Rocket League chat system ✔️
  - Better than using a script + macros to simulate keypresses, which is error prone and hacky (temporarily blocks gameplay inputs while chats are typed out)

## Installation

Find the latest version in [Releases](https://github.com/smallest-cock/CustomQuickchat/releases)

## Usage

1. In plugin settings, press `Open Bindings Menu` to create/edit chat bindings

2. Press `Save` when you're finished 
     
3. Flex your awesome chats in a match 😃

### To turn chats on/off:

Run/bind `customQuickchat_toggle` 

..... or just toggle the checkbox in plugin settings
