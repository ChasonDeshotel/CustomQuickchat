<img src='./docs/images/cover_pic.png' alt="overview" width="700"/>

<br>

Chats are sent through the native Rocket League chat system ✔️
  - Better than using a script + macros to simulate keypresses, which is error prone and hacky (temporarily blocks gameplay inputs while chats are typed out)


## Installation

Find the latest version in [Releases](https://github.com/smallest-cock/CustomQuickchat/releases)

## Usage

1. In plugin settings, click `Open Bindings Menu` to edit chat bindings and word variations
    - check out the [Settings guide](./docs/Settings.md) for all the special features

2. Click `Save` when you're finished
     
3. Flex your sick ass chats 😎

### To toggle chats on/off:

Run/bind `customQuickchat_toggle` 

..... or just toggle the checkbox in plugin settings
